# ChatBot
Mental issues can hit anyone really hard. Mental health issues is an extremely complex disease. No one knows exactly what causes it. A chatbot is a system that is able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual languages. Chatbots have potential to increase access to mental health interventions. In particular, chatbots may encourage interaction by those who have traditionally been reluctant to seek mental health advice due to stigmatization.  Some people may experience depression and feel overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness for no known reason. People dealing with depression want to tell their stories to somebody and they are mostly afraid to speak to their close friends and relatives. The best way of treating the mental health problems is to contact the doctors. Our chatbot provides guidance to the user by arranging a video or audio call meeting with the special psychologist available throughout the world by providing therapy.
